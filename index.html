        <h1>Welcome to Cindy's website</h1> <br><br>
        <h2>Cindy created this when she was 
            <br> trying to avoid resposibilities; 
            <br> if she ever sends you a website, 
            <br> it probably means that she was doing just that.</h2><br><br>
            <h3>disclaimer: this website is ugly because cindy doesn't know how to use css</h3><br><br><hr><br>
        <p>here are some images/videos for you to look at:</p> <br><br>
